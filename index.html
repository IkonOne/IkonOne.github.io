                I am a Computer Scientist and Roboticist with experience in computational geometry, computer vision, 3D reconstruction, mechatronics, 3D graphics and 3D printing.
                My dream is to work with a diverse team of engineers and researchers to solve difficult spatial reasoning problems on resource constrained hardware.

                With professional development experience dating back 10 years (that includes publishing over 20 games), I have returned to school to fill some of the knokwledge gaps my google university education missed.
                Having tested out of numerous courses up to the junior level, I have taken several graduate level courses and excelled at the research and independent study opportunities I pursued.
                I will graduate in May of 2022 with my Bachelors of Computer Science degree.

                The banner at the top of my website is a recreation of the first original program I wrote.
                The original version was written in C++ and rendered using OpenGL.
                I wrote it when I was 16 after learning the skills necessary from a pair of books.
