- Designed and implemented a communication protocol that facilitates data transfrer of sensor data from an Arduino to a Raspberry Pi over serial
- Created an OctoPrint plugin that streams sensor data to a industrial data collection system while a print is in progress
- Made design decisions based on the understanding that the implementation must be simple enough to allow undergraduate engineering students with little to no programming experience to add new sensors and process statistics
