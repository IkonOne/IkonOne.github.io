- Coordinated with a team of 5 undergraduate students to implement a driver for an industrial grade altitude, heading and reference sensor
- Leveraged existing experience to assist teammates in underestanding the structure of the massive Ardupilot code base and electronics communications interfaces
- Assisted teammates with debugging remotely executed code on a microcontroller using gdb
- Designed and led training on the fundamentals of an RTOS, packet parsing and error checking
