- Developed an OpenGL debug viewer that renders the inverted pendulum and a simple GUI
- Designed and implemented a communications protocol with a platform independent API
- Designed and executed experiments that identified that a simple PID controller can maintain stability with small disturbances with latency up to 1 second and packet loss up to 75%.
- Executed the design and development of an API that facilitates rapid development of experiments
- Coded, modeled and constructed an absolute position sensor using two infrared reflectance sensors along with debugging tools
- Reverse engineered and modified the inkjet cartridge motion system of an HP printer to serve as a cart
