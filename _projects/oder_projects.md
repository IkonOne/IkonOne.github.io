I started my journey into independent game development around 2010.
Along the way, I wrote numerous proofs of concept and prototypes, learning data structures, algorithms and clean coding practices along the way.
Here are some of the highlights that accurately demonstrate my programming interests to this day.

                        This is the project that helped me start landing contract work.
                        In it, I implemented a finite state machine, a quad-tree, steering behaviors, pseudo 3D graphics, marching squares, A* path finding and navigation meshes.

                The song is an absolute banger too.
                I wish I wrote it.

                        Another Ludum Dare game I made in 48 hours.
                        This game ended up going through several iterations post-jam in my first attempt at completing a real project.
                        I think that this project is the first time I implemented a PID controller.
                        I also implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline">Catmull Rom spline</a> for a custom camera controller.
