- Developed a novel algorithm that can be used to generate toolpaths in any 3D printing software that supports non-manifold surfaces
- Identified, [documented](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine/issues/1532) and [fixed a bug](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine/pull/1536) in the CuraEngine 3D printing slicing software that fixed toolpath generation in 'Surface Mode' printing
- Designed and developed a python+Qt application that is used in the BioMedical laboratory for 3D printing bone scaffolds

**Status**: Preliminary testing on the efficacy of Fisher-Koch S as an infill pattern for 3D printed bone scaffolding is underway.
Given promising results, the algorithm and software I developed will be used in clinical trials.
